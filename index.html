    <h1>How AI is Transforming Education: Unlocking the Future with EduGPT™</h1>
    <p>Education is evolving faster than ever, and at the heart of this transformation is artificial intelligence (AI). From personalized tutoring to instant content generation, AI is redefining how we learn. <strong>EduGPT™</strong> is leading this revolution, merging AI innovation with the art of teaching to make education smarter, more accessible, and more engaging than ever before.</p>

    <h2>The Problem with Traditional Education</h2>
    <p>For decades, education has largely remained a one-size-fits-all experience. While effective for some, this approach leaves many learners feeling disengaged, overlooked, or left behind. Here are the key challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uniformity Over Individuality:</strong> Standard curriculums fail to adapt to unique learning styles and paces.</li>
        <li><strong>Barriers to Access:</strong> Quality education is often expensive or geographically inaccessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Static Learning Models:</strong> Traditional methods struggle to engage a generation immersed in dynamic digital experiences.</li>
    </ul>
